# Description
A python application for calculating debts in a shared flat. Everyone can enter the amount of money that they spent on food, etc. and at the end of the month you can click on a button and the program makes the debts calculation for you. The program also includes a 'I'm-away'-function (don't count users that are currently not there) and a 'special-expense' function (certain expenses that should only be shared by a certain group of room mates). A preview video can be seen on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0Uj-u5oSks&t=428s). The application includes a weather-forecast and a radio-function.
